SCOPRO specifies the main concepts that are needed to model a supply chain. It includes the basic terms for representing the SC structure, its business processes and associated resources, as well as the relationships among them. SCOPRO makes explicit the organizational units that participate in a SC, their organizational components and roles, as well as the way these units are linked to processes.
Fig. 1 presents a UML class diagram that includes the main concepts of SCOPRO, which are organized around three perspectives, labeled as structure, processes and resources dimensions. The model includes the "SC Entity" concept, which is a generic and abstract concept representing every entity belonging to a SC.
