<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
SCOPRO (Supply Chain Process Ontology) is a subontology of SCONTO (Supply Chain Ontology), which is an ontology that formally describes a supply chain (SC) based on the SCOR de facto standard [1]. SCOPRO formalizes the SC essential concepts, capturing the organizational units participating in a supply chain, its structure, and business processes. It represents the SC business processes at various abstraction levels and their associated resources in a holistic fashion.
